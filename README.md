# Blackjack-Game
This is a text based blackjack game I created as part of an Intro to Computer Science course. 

This assignment had the following requirements:
  * Names of variables are meaningful and the program comments self-document the program.
  * Math operations
  * If/Else or Switch statements
  * 2 types of loops
  * Validated user input
  * Save the data to a sequential data file and read from it
  * 3 functions appropriately passing parameters and returning values as needed
  * Two dimensional arrays or vectors
  * Formatted output so it is easy to read and aligned
  * The program must execute without error and the output must be correct
